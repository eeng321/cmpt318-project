# cmpt318-project

This R program takes a large data set of yearly power consumption in an area and analyzes for any anomalies within the time period specified. 

The program detects complex and point anomalies in data sets and displays them on a coloured graph. The results are separated into time frames of weekends and weekdays from each season of the year.

The results are grouped into two seasonal categories:
  - Winter and Fall
  - Summer and Spring 
The power consumption throughout Spring and Summer are quite similar to each other in comparison to Winter and Fall so the seasons were combined.
